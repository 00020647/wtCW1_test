                    Dear parents!
                    The administration of school 35 informs you that from the 2022-23 academic year, a single school uniform will be introduced throughout the Republic, which can be purchased centrally in special stores that have permission to sell the new model uniform.
                    <!-- For students of our school, you, dear parents, will be able to purchase a uniform in stores that will be open near the Dynamo stadium by the end of July. They will sell the uniform that we will require specifically in our educational institution. Therefore, 
                    do not rush to purchase a uniform in other places! Exact information about the opening of these stores will be communicated in the school information channels -->
